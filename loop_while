% while loop example
% different from the loop_basic example as you can use this for unknown no of loops
%
% LOGIC
%	    while(expression),
%		  do something;
%	end
% 
% will repeat until the expression is false - if not it may loop infinitely
% if you get stuck in a nevernding loop, Octave stop is CTRL+C


    i = 1
    while i < 9,   % upper limit
     disp(i);
     i=i+1;       % print will stop at 9 since 9 + 1 is not less than 9
    end
